# What Does Janitor Monkey Do?

Janitor Monkey is a tool used in DevOps to help keep cloud resources clean and optimized. It works by automatically cleaning up unused resources that are no longer needed, 
which can save costs and prevent unnecessary clutter. For example, it can delete old instances, unused disks, or unassigned IP addresses in cloud environments like AWS. 
By removing these unused resources, Janitor Monkey helps maintain a more organized and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure.

The main idea behind Janitor Monkey is to reduce the manual work required to monitor and clean up resources. It's especially helpful in environments where resources can be 
created dynamically and might not always get cleaned up properly. By using Janitor Monkey, teams don't have to spend time tracking down resources to delete manually, and the 
tool makes sure that everything stays within budget.

It also works by setting up specific rules or schedules for when resources should be cleaned up. For example, it might automatically remove unused resources after a certain 
period of time or only if they're not attached to any active services. Janitor Monkey can be a huge time-saver and helps make sure that your cloud environment doesn't end up 
with a bunch of unnecessary stuff running around.
