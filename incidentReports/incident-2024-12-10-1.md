# Incident: 2024-12-10 13-16-00

## Summary

Between 13:16 and 13:31 UTC on December 10, 2024, all users experienced significantly increased latency when placing pizza orders. The issue caused delays of up to 30 seconds for order requests. This semi-critical incident was caused by a TA injecting a change that increased response time from the pizza factory service. The event lasted 15 minutes and was resolved when the report URL in the response was reviewed, which helped identify and address the issue.

## Detection

The incident was first noticed at 13:16 UTC on December 10, 2024, when the Pizza Creation Latency alert notified the team. Metrics indicated a sharp increase in latency for order requests to the pizza factory service. There were no delays in response from the team, and notifications were sent to multiple people from the start.

## Impact

For 15 minutes between 13:16 and 13:31 UTC, all users attempting to place pizza orders experienced significant delays, with latency reaching up to 30 seconds. This impacted the user experience, but no support cases or complaints were reported during the incident.

## Response

The incident was detected and resolved by Kyler Moulton, who was on-call during the event. Kyler responded immediately upon noticing the latency increase, identified the root cause as a chaos test injection, and took the necessary action by accessing the report URL. Since the issue was resolved by this URL, no further actions were needed, and the incident did not require any escalations.

# Root cause

The root cause of the incident was the injection of delays into the pizza-factory response due to a chaos test designed to simulate real-world disruptions. This caused increased latency when placing orders but did not prevent the orders from being processed.

## Resolution

The incident was resolved by accessing the report URL injected during the chaos test, which returned the message "Chaos resolved". No modifications to the code were necessary, as the issue was resolved externally.

# Prevention

This incident was caused by a chaos test injection. To prevent future occurrences:

- A more controlled environment for testing chaos engineering should be implemented to avoid impacting production services.
- Security measures should be enhanced to restrict the types of chaos injections allowed.
- Monitoring systems should be reviewed to ensure immediate notification of injected chaos or unexpected disruptions.

# Action items

- Kyler Moulton will continue to track any potential impact of chaos testing in Grafana.
- Security measures will be reviewed to prevent unauthorized chaos injections in the future.
